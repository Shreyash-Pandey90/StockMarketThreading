Java Multithreading - Stock Market Simulator
This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of Java multithreading through a Stock Market simulation application. Each example illustrates a specific multithreading concept in a real-world context.

Key Multithreading Concepts Covered

Understanding the Need for Multithreading

Comparison of single-threaded vs. multi-threaded stock price updates
Performance benefits demonstrated with multiple independent tasks


Creating Threads

Implementation of the Runnable interface
Thread creation and management


Thread Synchronization

Demonstration of race conditions in stock trading
Using synchronized methods and blocks to prevent data corruption


Thread Pool Management

Showing the overhead of creating too many threads
Using ExecutorService and thread pools for efficient thread management


Scenario Analysis

Identifying situations where multithreading is beneficial
Understanding scenarios where multithreading may not improve performance



How to Run the Examples
Each Java file contains a main() method and can be run independently to demonstrate a specific concept:
bash# Compile
javac -d bin src/com/stockmarket/basics/SingleThreadedStockUpdater.java

# Run
java -cp bin com.stockmarket.basics.SingleThreadedStockUpdater


Tips for Successful Execution

Run the basic examples first: Start with SingleThreadedStockUpdater and MultiThreadedStockUpdater to understand the performance difference.
Observe the race condition: Run UnsynchronizedStockTrader several times to see how race conditions can lead to incorrect results.
Compare thread pools: Run the ThreadPoolDemo to see how using a thread pool can be more efficient than creating many individual threads.
Follow the README: The README provides a comprehensive guide to all concepts and how to run each example.
Learning Outcomes

Understand when and why to use multithreading
Create threads by implementing the Runnable interface
Recognize the need for synchronization in concurrent applications
Apply synchronized keyword to methods and code blocks
Recognize when excessive thread usage is detrimental to performance
Identify appropriate scenarios for multithreading application
